## About

Scholarsome <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88sk%C3%A4l%C9%99rs(%C9%99)m%2F">(pronounced ˈskälərs(ə)m/)</a> is a web-based and open source studying system. Through the use of flashcards, among other core features, users can practice memorization of terms and definitions, along with keeping their data secure locally.

While other services have begun to paywall core functionalities, Scholarsome intends to offer an equal alternative that does not compromise on features.

Scholarsome is accessible at https://scholarsome.com for individuals who are not interested in hosting it themselves. It is free and runs the same as the most recently released version.

However, the service can be hosted yourself on any system. For those wishing to self-host Scholarsome, documentation for installation can be found <a href="https://scholarsome.com/handbook/installation/prerequisites">here.</a>

## Development

For development purposes, Scholarsome is required to be installed outside the standard container-based system that is used for production installs. Documentation for development can be found <a href="https://scholarsome.com/handbook/development/development-guide">here.</a>

While we use many technologies, some of our most prominent are:

- <a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a>
- <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>
- <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a>
